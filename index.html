				<h2>A brief history</h2>
				<p>
				My first job out of college was as a black box software QA Engineer for Macromedia.  This meant I wrote absolutely zero code, tracked automated test suite results and wrote bug reports (which I was very good at).

				Eventually I found my way into the career I dreamed of, Visual FX.  I progressed up from 3D generalist, to 2D Compositor on films, tv and games <a target="_blank" href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2699540/">[imdb page]</a> and finally held the position of Motion Capture Supervisor at studios in San Francisco and San Diego.

				<p>This is a proof of concept involving a pipeline for creating 3D scenes out of 2D images. Maya uses Python as a quick scripting language while writing plug-ins requires C++.  A common practice is to prototype tools in Python and then later convert to and compile in C++ for far superior performance. The repo is of a Python tool which automates the process.</p>
